The image formation process can be described by the ideal pin-hole model where only the light rays from the depicted scene that passes through the aperture can fall on the image plane.In reality this ideal image formation process doesnot exists. and hence image quality can be measured as the deviation of the image with respect to the original model. image quality is a characteristics of an image that measures the degradation of an image compared to the ideal or perfect image. Imaging systems may introduce some amount of distortion or artifacts in the image. So suppose in a digital camera, the image quality depends on the storage, compression and transmission of an image. Neglecting transmission, unless we have a lossless compression system, the output image will be different from the original image. 
In a digital camera the image quality depends on three factors - one is how much the image formation process of the camera deviates from the ideal camera pin-hole model. and also the in what encoding the image is stored whether it is png or jpg format.

Image quality can be measured in two ways-
- Full reference method in which the image quality of a test image is measured with respect to a reference image that is assumed to have perfect quality. For example the comparing of an image with the jpeg converted image is a full reference.
- No reference method in which the image quality is not measured with respect to a reference.
